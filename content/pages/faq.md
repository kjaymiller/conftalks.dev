Title: Frequently Asked Questions
slug: faq

## This page hopes to answers all the questions you may have regarding the *Conftalks Project*

**What is ConfTalks?**<br>
Conftalks is a notification platform designed to help developers find conferences that they would be interested in attending and giving talks to. 

**Is it free?**<br>
Currently it is free for developers and conferences! In the future, there may be a premium tier for both, **but you will NEVER be restricted accessing conferences**.

**Is it supported?**<br>
It is currently supported by [Jay Miller](https://kjaymiller.com) a developer/automator. 

**Does it plan to make money?**<br>
Yes! In fact we are looking for sponsors and supporters. You can email [jay@conftalks.dev](mailto:jay@conftalks.dev) if you are interested.

**Do we give/sell developer information to conferences or third-parties**
We do intend to let conferences know anonymous marketing data about the developers interested in their conference. This is limited to the following:

* How many develoeprs saw their conference
* How many people signed up to be reminded about their conference (and a count of each type)
* How many people in a given area could be notified of their conference.

**WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION to third-parties**

**Is it open-source?**<br>
At the present time it isn't in the plans to open-source this platform *completely*. Although there are certain areas of this project the may be open-source. 

**Are their plans to sell ConfTalks**
We aren't taking that off the table. There is a lot of work that is done (for free) on this project and while our plan is to accept donations and sponsors to continue development if a buyer offered the right price, we would listen. 

If you are worried about this product being sold the best thing to do is to continue to promote and share this site with others and convince people to support the project with a [one-time](mailto:jay@conftalks.dev) or [recurring donation](mailto:jay@conftalks.dev). 

**How far into development is it?**<br>
We are currently in Pre-Alpha Release. This means that there is a lot of work to be done, but the baseline features are ready.
